Probably one of the smallest SSL MITM proxies you can make. Only using openssl, netcat and a couple of other standard command line tools.

Writes all incoming client traffic to one file and all response traffic from the server to another file.

Put some sed commands in there and you can even modify traffic ("an exercise for the reader").
